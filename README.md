Vulcan - A Space Shooter

So this was made way back in May but I'm uploading it now because the assets I used were commissioned privately from an artist, who's now given the thumbs up to freely redistribute them.

This is Vulcan, a project I spent working on for over 3 weeks, at more than 8 hours a day on days I had classes, and more than 15 hours a day on days I didn't have classes. On the days leading to the final deadline I spent three sleepless nights on it. That adds up to between 150 and 170 hours total spent on this.

It's not complete, and I don't have the motivation to complete it. Maybe in the future. For now, with the given deadline I had back then, this was what I was able to do.

You can compile it using the game.sh file present in the folder.

Enjoy!
